# register-search-cart

I'd like to create a domain name registrar that allows people to search for and register domain names. If the domain is available, it should allow them to click a button to add it to their shopping cart. If it's not available, a message should be displayed with related suggestions of available domains in different tlds or with slightly different spellings.

It should track client status codes (https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/epp-status-codes-2014-06-16-en) and allow for the 5 major actions required of registrars - create update delete renew and transfer
